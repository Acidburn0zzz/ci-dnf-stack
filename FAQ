Q: I have patches for multiple projects (libhif, dnf, dnf-plugins-core), how do I build RPMs with those?
A: Not that trivial, but possible!
   0. You need to have working rpm-gitoverlay (find instructions at https://github.com/ignatenkobrain/rpm-gitoverlay#installation)
   1. Copy overlays/dnf-master/overlay.yml and edit it (remove unneded components, add branch tags, etc.)
   2. Build (S)RPM(s): https://github.com/ignatenkobrain/rpm-gitoverlay#usage
      2.1. To use existing git repositories, use --gitdir option
      2.2. To build just SRPM(s): rpm-gitoverlay build-overlay srpm
      2.3. To build RPM(s): rpm-gitoverlay build-overlay rpm [BUILDER], where builder is copr/rpmbuild with some additional parameters (see -h/--help)

Q: I have RPMs, how do I run functional/integration tests locally?
A: Easily!
   1. Put your RPMs into "rpms" directory in repo
   2. sudo docker build --no-cache --force-rm -t $MY_SUPER_CONTAINER .
   3. sudo docker run --rm $MY_SUPER_CONTAINER launch-test $MY_COOL_TEST dnf-3
