Q: How to download latest RPMs from nightly?
A: curl --silent http://ci.dnf.baseurl.org/job/nightly-fedora-24-x86_64/lastStableBuild/consoleText | grep "^https://copr.*\.rpm" | xargs wget

Q: I have patches for multiple projects (libhif, dnf, dnf-plugins-core), how do I build RPMs with those?
A: Not that trivial, but possible!
   0. You need to have working rpm-gitoverlay (find instructions at https://github.com/ignatenkobrain/rpm-gitoverlay#installation)
   1. Copy overlays/dnf-master/overlay.yml and edit it (remove unneded components, add branch tags, etc.)
   2. Build (S)RPM(s): https://github.com/ignatenkobrain/rpm-gitoverlay#usage
      2.1. To use existing git repositories, use --gitdir option
      2.2. To build just SRPM(s): rpm-gitoverlay build-overlay srpm
      2.3. To build RPM(s): rpm-gitoverlay build-overlay rpm [BUILDER], where builder is copr/rpmbuild with some additional parameters (see -h/--help)

Q: I have RPMs, how do I run functional/integration tests locally?
A: Easily!
   1. Put your RPMs into "rpms" directory in repo
   2. CONTAINER=$(./dnf-testing.sh build)
   3. ./dnf-testing.sh run -c $CONTAINER
   X. See ./dnf-testing.sh --help
