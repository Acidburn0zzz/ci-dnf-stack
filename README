dnf-stack-ci
============

dnf-stack-ci is a set of scripts that allow continuous testing of the
`DNF <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf>`_ stack.

This serves as an ad hoc solution to where to store routines that belong
to all the components of the stack. Once they are in the final shape, it
would be nice to merge them into the respective components.

These scripts are free and open-source software; see the section License
to understand the terms and conditions under which you can use, study,
modify and distribute dnf-stack-ci.


Features
--------

Refer to the test suite for the complete list of all the features. I
have, nevertheless, mentioned few of them below in hope of gaining your
attention:

- build RPMs of tito-enabled projects
- build RPMs of librepo project forks
- build RPMs of libcomps project forks
- configure Mock's "config_opts['target_arch']" option
- add repositories to Mock's "config_opts['yum.conf']" option
- define RPM macros
- configure Mock's "config_opts['root']" option
- configure release numbers of librepo and libcomps RPMs

The routines are not in the final shape yet. Further features are added
on demand if they fit the purpose of the repository.

Contributions
-------------

Since I am a bit demanding person and I want to avoid any unnecessary
conflicts, I don't accept any contributions. On the other hand, once
it turns out that there is a potential contributor, I'll move the
repository under https://github.com/rpm-software-management/ where the
contributions can be accepted.
