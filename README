dnf-stack-ci
============

dnf-stack-ci is a set of scripts that allow continuous testing of the
`DNF <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf>`_ stack.

This serves as an ad hoc solution to where to store routines that belong
to all the components of the stack. Once they are in the final shape, it
would be nice to merge them into the respective components.

These scripts are free and open-source software; see the section License
to understand the terms and conditions under which you can use, study,
modify and distribute dnf-stack-ci.


Features
--------

The routines are not in the final shape yet. Further features are added
on demand if they fit the purpose of the repository.

Contributions
-------------

Since I am a bit demanding person and I want to avoid any unnecessary
conflicts, I don't accept any contributions. On the other hand, once
it turns out that there is a potential contributor, I'll move the
repository under https://github.com/rpm-software-management/ where the
contributions can be accepted.
