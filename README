ci-dnf-stack
============

ci-dnf-stack is a set of scripts that allow continuous testing of the
`DNF <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf>`_ stack.

This serves as an ad hoc solution to where to store routines that belong
to all the components of the stack. It would be nice to merge them into
the respective components.

These scripts are free and open-source software; see the section License
to understand the terms and conditions under which you can use, study,
modify and distribute ci-dnf-stack.

- build RPMs of tito-enabled projects
- build RPMs of librepo project forks
- build RPMs of libcomps project forks
